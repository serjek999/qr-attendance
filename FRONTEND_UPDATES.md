- Proper touch interactions
- Responsive layouts

## Testing Credentials

### Staff Login (username@domain format):

- **Admin**: `admin@admin` / `admin123`
- **Faculty**: `faculty@faculty` / `faculty123`
- **SBO**: `sbo@sbo` / `sbo123`

### Student Login (school ID):

- **Student 1**: `2023123456` / `Smith2023-01-15`
- **Student 2**: `2023987654` / `Doe2023-01-15`

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 2. Database Setup

- Run `supabase-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL editor
- Insert initial test data using the SQL provided in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

### 3. Dependencies

```bash
npm install qrcode bcryptjs
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Efficient Queries

- Proper use of Supabase's query builder
- Selective data loading
- Pagination for large datasets

### 2. Caching

- Client-side caching of user data
