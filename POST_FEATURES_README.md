# Post Features Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of enhanced post features including like functionality and image upload capabilities across all user portals (Student, SBO, Faculty, Admin).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Post Likes Functionality

- **Universal Like System**: All user types (students, SBO officers, faculty, admins) can now like and unlike posts
- **Real-time Updates**: Like counts update immediately when users interact with posts
- **Visual Feedback**: Heart icon fills with red color when a post is liked
- **Database Integration**: Uses the `post_likes` table with proper RLS policies

### 2. Image Upload System

- **3-Image Limit**: Users can upload up to 3 images per post
- **File Validation**:
  - Only image files accepted (jpg, png, gif, etc.)
  - 5MB file size limit per image
  - Automatic file type detection
- **Preview System**: Real-time image previews before posting
- **Remove Functionality**: Users can remove selected images before posting
- **Grid Layout**: Images display in responsive grid (1-3 columns based on count)

### 3. Enhanced Post Creation

- **Rich Content**: Posts can now contain both text and images
- **Upload Progress**: Visual feedback during image upload process
- **Validation**: Ensures posts have either text content or images
- **Storage Integration**: Images stored in Supabase Storage bucket

## Database Changes

### Posts Table Updates

```sql
-- Added images field to posts table
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN images TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';
-- Added likes_count for performance
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### Post Likes Table Updates

```sql
-- Extended post_likes to support all user types
ALTER TABLE post_likes ADD COLUMN faculty_id UUID REFERENCES faculty(id);
ALTER TABLE post_likes ADD COLUMN sbo_officer_id UUID REFERENCES sbo_officers(id);
ALTER TABLE post_likes ADD COLUMN admin_id UUID REFERENCES admins(id);

-- Updated constraints and policies for all user types
```

- ✅ Enhanced post creation form
- ✅ Image preview and removal

## User Experience Features

### Image Upload Process

1. **Select Images**: Click "Photo" button to open file picker
2. **Preview**: Selected images appear as thumbnails with remove buttons
3. **Validation**: System checks file type, size, and count limits
4. **Upload**: Images upload to Supabase Storage during post creation
5. **Display**: Images show in responsive grid layout in posts

### Like Interaction

1. **Click Heart**: Users can like/unlike posts by clicking the heart icon
2. **Visual Feedback**: Heart fills with red color when liked
3. **Count Update**: Like count updates immediately
4. **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for like actions

## Technical Implementation

### File Upload Flow

```javascript
// 1. File selection and validation
const handleImageSelect = (event) => {
  const files = Array.from(event.target.files);
  // Validate count, type, and size
};

// 2. Upload to Supabase Storage
const uploadImages = async () => {
  for (const image of selectedImages) {
    const fileName = `${Date.now()}-${Math.random()}-${image.name}`;
    await supabase.storage.from("post-images").upload(fileName, image);
  }
};

// 3. Save URLs to database
const imageUrls = await uploadImages();
await supabase.from("posts").insert({
  content: newPost,
  images: imageUrls,
  // ... other fields
});
```

### Like System Flow

```javascript
// 1. Check if user already liked
const { data: existingLike } = await supabase
  .from("post_likes")
  .select("*")
  .eq("post_id", postId)
  .eq("user_type_id", user.id);

// 2. Toggle like status
if (existingLike) {
  await supabase.from("post_likes").delete().eq("id", existingLike.id);
} else {
  await supabase.from("post_likes").insert({
    post_id: postId,
    user_type_id: user.id,
  });
}
```

## Storage Configuration

### Supabase Storage Bucket

- **Bucket Name**: `post-images`
- **Public Access**: Enabled for image display
- **File Naming**: Timestamp + random string + original name
- **Security**: RLS policies control access

### Image Display

- **Grid Layout**: Responsive 1-3 column grid
- **Aspect Ratio**: Fixed height (h-32) with object-cover
- **Loading**: Optimized image loading with alt text

## Error Handling

### Upload Errors

- File type validation
- File size limits (5MB per image)
- Upload failure recovery
- Network error handling

### Like Errors

- Database constraint violations
- Network connectivity issues
- User permission errors

## Performance Optimizations

### Database

- **Likes Count**: Cached count in posts table
- **Triggers**: Automatic count updates on like/unlike
- **Indexes**: Optimized queries for post_likes table

### Frontend

- **Lazy Loading**: Images load on demand
- **State Management**: Efficient React state updates
- **Debouncing**: Prevent rapid like/unlike actions

## Security Considerations

### File Upload Security

- File type validation (client + server)
- File size limits
- Secure file naming
- Storage bucket permissions

### Database Security

- RLS policies for all user types
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Input sanitization
- User permission checks
