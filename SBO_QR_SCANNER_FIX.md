# SBO QR Scanner Fix

## Issues Fixed

The SBO QR scanner was not functioning properly due to several issues:

1. **Missing QR Code Detection**: The `FixedQRScanner.js` component was only showing a video feed without actual QR code detection
2. **Incomplete Integration**: The scanner wasn't properly integrated with the attendance system
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No proper error handling for camera permissions and scanner initialization
4. **BarcodeDetector Compatibility Issues**: The HTML5-QRCode library had compatibility issues with the BarcodeDetector API

## Changes Made

### 1. FixedQRScanner.js

- **Replaced HTML5-QRCode with qr-scanner library** for better compatibility
- Implemented actual QR code detection functionality
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Added test mode for debugging
- Improved camera initialization and cleanup

### 2. SBO Home Page (page.js)

- Integrated scanner with attendance recording system
- Added proper student lookup by school_id and id
- Implemented automatic attendance recording on successful scan
- Added time window validation for attendance recording

### 3. QR Code Generator

- Updated to generate simpler QR codes containing just student ID
- Improved compatibility with the scanner

## Technical Details

### Scanner Library Change

- **Previous**: HTML5-QRCode library (had BarcodeDetector compatibility issues)
- **Current**: qr-scanner library (more reliable and compatible)

### Scanner Configuration

The scanner now uses a simpler, more reliable configuration:

- Direct video element integration
- Custom overlay for visual feedback
- Proper error handling for decode errors
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

### QR Code Format

- QR codes should contain just the student ID (e.g., "STU001")
- The scanner looks up students by school_id first, then by id
- Attendance is automatically recorded based on current time windows

### Time Windows

- **Time In**: 7:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Time Out**: 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- Attendance is only recorded during these windows

## How to Test

### 0. Add Test Data (Required)

Before testing, you need to add a test student to the database:

1. **Run the test data script**:

   ```sql
   -- Execute the add-test-student.sql file in your database
   -- This will create a test student with ID "STU001"
   ```

2. **Or manually add a test student**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO tribes (name, description) VALUES ('Test Tribe', 'Test tribe');
   INSERT INTO students (school_id, first_name, last_name, full_name, email, year_level, tribe_id)
   VALUES ('STU001', 'Test', 'Student', 'Test Student', 'test@test.com', '1st Year',
          (SELECT id FROM tribes WHERE name = 'Test Tribe'));
   ```

### 1. Generate Test QR Codes

1. Navigate to the SBO portal
2. Go to the "QR Generator" tab
3. Enter a student ID (e.g., "STU001")
4. Generate and download the QR code

### 2. Test the Scanner

1. Go to the "Scan" tab in the SBO portal
2. Click "Start QR Scanner"
3. Allow camera permissions when prompted
4. Use the "Test Scan" button to simulate a QR scan (in test mode)
5. Or scan a real QR code by pointing the camera at it

### 3. Verify Attendance Recording

1. After a successful scan, check that attendance is recorded
2. Verify the student information is displayed correctly
3. Check that time-in/time-out is recorded based on current time
4. **Success popup should appear** with attendance confirmation
